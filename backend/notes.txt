errors i treat:

- non existing entities (if you try to manage a non existing grid or rover)
- two rovers on the same coordinate (it is not possible to land a rover in a spot there is already another one)
- rovers landing on outranging grid coordinates (if you try to land a rover in a spot outside the grid)
- invalid directions or instructions
